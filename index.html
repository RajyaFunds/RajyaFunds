Hi Claude! Could you design error handling? If you need more information from me, ask me 1-2 key questions right away. If you think I should upload any documents that would help you do a better job, let me know. You can use the tools you have access to ‚Äî like Google Drive, web search, etc. ‚Äî if they‚Äôll help you better accomplish this task. Do not use analysis tool. Please keep your responses friendly, brief and conversational. 

Please execute the task as soon as you can - an artifact would be great if it makes sense. If using an artifact, consider what kind of artifact (interactive, visual, checklist, etc.) might be most helpful for this specific task. Thanks for your help!

Edit
I'd love to help you design error handling! To create the most useful solution for you, I need to know:

What type of application or system are you building error handling for? (web app, mobile app, API, database system, etc.)
What programming language or framework are you using?
Once I know these details, I can create a comprehensive error handling design with code examples, best practices, and implementation patterns tailored to your specific needs!

Perfect! Let me guide you step by step like you're just starting out:

First, let's clean up your GitHub repos:

KEEP these files:

index.html (this will be your main website homepage)
style.css (for styling)
CNAME (this connects your domain rajyafunds.in)
README.md (good to have for documentation)
You can DELETE these:

calculator-main.js (unless your new website needs a calculator)
helpers.js (old code you won't need)
culator.html (seems like old calculator page)
Simple steps:

Delete the files you don't need from your GitHub repo
Yes, please share your detailed prompt now!
I'll create a complete new index.html file with everything built-in
You'll just replace your current index.html with my new code
Your website will be live at rajyafunds.in immediately!
